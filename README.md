# HarvestHorizon

Welcome to Harvest Horizon, this is a project made by me for the Boilermake Hackathon hosted in Spring 2024.

## Idea

I got this idea from the Financial Times Save the Climate game, it was quite interesting to make this website. The portion of creating the "game" per se was quite complex as I had to create over 700 lines of questions to ensure the game could be played for at least 4-5 rounds. Currently, it is not as developed as I would like as it was a 36 
hour hackathon I wasn't able to adjust for statistics, and scoring. Thus in the future I look to make this more gamelike and hopefully create a unique experience through which people can learn about food scarcity in 2050 whilst enjoying the process and making choices for themselves. 

## What did I use to code this?

I used HTML and CSS for the majority of the process, yes every element you see is HTML and CSS as those are the languages I was the most comfortable in. I do hope to maybe transition the UI to another language in the future maybe React or the like.
